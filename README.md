Drow worD Processor

This is Drow, the basic word processor from Team Full-Duplex.
Coded in 3 months for our Team Project.

Abandon hope all ye who venture past this point,
for this be the land of undocumented libraries and shitty Swing code.

This is a student project, full of bugs an likely not to run.
It is recommened you do not run at all, however if you choose to, there are some known problems.

  - Going fullscreen on Macs will likely cause the machine to freeze.
  - Word documents, although techinically supported, will be come courrupt if opened or saved in Drow.
  - Opening an RTF will make the file become uneditable.
  - I have no idea how this runs on Linux machines.
  
To repeat, this is a student project, for educational purposes only.
